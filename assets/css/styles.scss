// Need the above so that Jekyll knows what to do with the markdown
// Below we seperate out our styles into different files that we can have control over

@import "var";  // we will create a variables style sheet to allow us to store site wide variabels
@import "main"; // we will create a site wide style sheet to contain larger global style items
@import "nav": // this is the vavigation style sheet








// this is going to go last all the time
@import "media-query"; // all my media queries go here - all your base are belong to us


// We can continue this pattern, and create specific style sheets for specific areas of our site.
